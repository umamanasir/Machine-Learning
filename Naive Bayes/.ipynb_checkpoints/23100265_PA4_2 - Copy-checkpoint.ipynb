    "# Programming Assignment 2: Naïve Bayes\n",
    "## Part 2: Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Name: Umama Nasir Abbasi\n",
    "#### Roll Number: 23100265\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "*   In this part of the assignment you will be implementing a Naïve Bayes Classification Model for classification from scratch.\n",
    "*   Your code must be in the Python programming language.\n",
    "*   You are encouraged to use procedural programming and throughly comment your code.\n",
    "*   For Part 2, you can only use standard libraries i.e. numpy, pandas, regex, matplotlib and scipy. You are **not** allowed to use any machine learning toolkits or libraries for training and testing your model. \n",
    "*   **Carefully read the submission guidelines, plagiarism and late days policy.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Guidelines\n",
    "Submit your code both as notebook file (.ipynb) and python script (.py) as individual files on LMS. Name both files as RollNumber_PA2_PartNum, i.e. this part should be named as `2xxxxxxx_PA4_2`. If you don’t know how to save .ipynb as .py see [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/L1rQH.png). Failing to submit any one of them might result in the reduction of marks. All cells **MUST** be run to get credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plagiarism Policy\n",
    "The code **MUST** be done independently. Any plagiarism or cheating of work from others or the internet will be immediately referred to the DC. If you are confused about what constitutes plagiarism, it is **YOUR** responsibility to consult with the instructor or the TA in a timely manner. No “after the fact” negotiations will be possible. The only way to guarantee that you do not lose marks is **DO NOT LOOK AT ANYONE ELSE'S CODE NOR DISCUSS IT WITH THEM**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Late Days Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "The deadline for the assignment is final. However, in order to accommodate all the 11th-hour issues, there is a late submission policy i.e. you can submit your assignment within 3 days after the deadline with a 25% deduction each day.\n"

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, you will be implementing and training a Naïve Bayes Classification model to classify news articles into different categories. Specifically, you will need to implement [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lNXwNpU6ydeP8I6cPsXLdbA4RQu17G9E/view?usp=sharing) algorithm. For more details of the algorithm and insights into the Naïve Bayes, you can also consult [Chapter 4](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/4.pdf) of the Speech and Language Processing book as reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "You will be using the [AG News Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amananandrai/ag-news-classification-dataset) for the purposes of this part of the assignment. This contains 120,000 training samples and 7600 testing samples of news articles belonging to 4 categories: World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech. \n",
    "The data has already been spilt into train and test files.\n",
    "You're required to implement a model that classifies the articles among the 4 aforementioned categories."
